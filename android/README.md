# CS Games 2019 - Mobile - Android App

This project serves as a starting base for the CS Games 2019 Mobile Competition.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before beginning:

- Latest version of Android Studio (3.3.1)
- Recent version of the Android SDK (at least API 28)

You can download these from the [Android Developer website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

> **NOTE:** If you have a Mac computer running macOS 10.13.6 or later, you may also be interested in our [iOS app](https://github.com/mirego/csgames19-competition/blob/master/ios/), which uses Xcode and the latest iOS SDK.

## Getting started

First, clone the project from Github:

```
git clone git@github.com:mirego/csgames19-competition.git
```

Then, in Android Studio: 

- Select **Import project (Eclipse, ADT, Gradle, etc.)** in the Welcome Screen, go find the `android/` folder in the repository you just cloned, and click **OK**.
- Once the project is open, click on **Sync Project with Gradle Files** in the main toolbar (or use the option from the `File` menu).

Once you see a `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` notice in the Gradle Console, your environment should be ready to build and run the project.

## Building the project

The project should have already been configured as an Android project in Android Studio, therefore you should see a target named `app` in the main toolbar, with **Play** and **Debug** buttons on its right.

Press on the **Debug** icon, and if you don't already have one, [create a new Android Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html), then select it to run the project.

Once the app appears running in your Virtual Device, your environment is ready for the competition.
